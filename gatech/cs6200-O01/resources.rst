Beej's guides are also well regarded and free for browsing online (you can purchase copies as well).

through and search for specific system calls). This is maintained by the author of The Linux Programming Interface.

A pointer type in C is just the pointee type followed by a asterisk (*)...

::

   int* - type: pointer to int
   float* - type: pointer to float
   struct fraction* - type: pointer to struct fraction
   struct fraction** - type: pointer to struct fraction*

Why are pointer bugs so common?

Try to remember to assign your pointers to refer to pointees. Don't be surprised when you forget.
